    "1. This program needs a user key from Darqube.com, which it uses to get real-time stock prices.\n",
    "   Go to the Darqube website get a user account and choose the free service. Then get your key.\n",
    "   Find the Dar_key line just below the \"User Parameters\" block in the cell below.\n",
    "   Enter it between the quotes on the line:  DAR_key = ''\n",
    "   \n",
    "   To test the program, run a short list of tickers. At the bottom of the next cell (cell #1), find this line: \n",
    "   #TICKERS = ('QCOM', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NVDA')\n",
    "   Delete the # at the start of the line. Now it will run with only these four tickers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   When you want to run all tickers, type the # back at the start of the line.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Occasionally one ticker hangs up, either in getting the price or getting the option string. When the program crashes, \n",
    "   read the last line before the crash. Getting price (or data) for XXXX.\" Simply delete the ticker XXXX from the ticker list. \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. OptionGun produces these csv files:\n",
    "     all_options_suffix.csv. This file contains every option available for every ticker in the list. \n",
    "     Put_STO_short_Tonka.csv. Best STO options that meet criteria and expiry < 50 days out.\n",
    "     Put_STO_mid_Tonka.csv.   Best STO options that meet criteria and 50 days <= expiry < 150 days out.\n",
